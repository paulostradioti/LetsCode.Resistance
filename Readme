# Heading 1

## Further Work
* Track the Treason Reports to avoid that the same Rebel reports the same traitor more then once
* Allow only items that have points to be passed in the Inventory during a Rebel Insertion in the system


## Assumptions
* Since the Traitors should not appear in any reports, it doesn't make sense to list them among the Rebels in the _GET api/Rebel_ endpoint.
